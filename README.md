# Project II RADIOO APP :musical_note:

Web app created by students of the Wild Code School using React.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone our Repository : https://github.com/saravalencia/Project2-radio.git

2. Installing:

### `npm install`

3. Launch the web app:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Built with 

* [React](https://reactjs.org/): We used Hooks like State and Effect, also we implemented React Context and React Router.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): For dependency managment.

* [Css](https://www.w3.org ): To style our application.

* [Radio Browser API](https://www.radio-browser.info/#/):The API used for this project.

* [Amcharts4-geodata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amcharts/amcharts4-geodata): A chart world map, that we use to render our map and connect to our API.


## Project RoadMap

To start with the project, we decided to create the wireframe first to get an idea of how to structure the page. To do this we use Adobe XD. The project is done with react and node.js and we implement a library for the map and an API “Radio Browser API” to collect the information from all the radios, this API allows us to access 30000 radio stations that are updated constantly, making it a stable API. 

## Our objective
Make a website that shows the radios of the country of one's choice in the world and allow you to play and save them to continue listening to them in the future.
 
## Authors
We are a group of 4 students from the Wild Code School bootcamp: Alba, Manuel, Virgina and Sara, this is our second project during a 5 month bootcamp, we created this project while learning the basics of React and after 1 month since the start of the bootcamp, we also had one month to develop this web app.
